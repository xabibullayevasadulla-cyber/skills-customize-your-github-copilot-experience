# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

Build the classic Hangman word-guessing game in Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. The program should be a console application that is easy to run and test.

**Skills practiced:** String manipulation, loops, conditionals, random selection

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build the Hangman game

#### Description
Create a console-based Hangman game where the program selects a secret word at random and the player guesses letters until they reveal the word or run out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses and show current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ )
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End when the word is correctly guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display clear win and lose messages

### 🛠️ Add optional enhancements

#### Description
Add at least one optional feature to improve usability or replayability. These are not required but will earn extra credit.

#### Requirements
Completed program should include one or more of the following enhancements (pick at least one):

- Show letters already guessed
- Validate input (ignore non-letters, repeated guesses)
- Difficulty levels that change the number of allowed mistakes
- Read the word list from an external file (e.g., `words.txt`)
- Provide a hint system (reveal one letter or give a clue)

---

If starter code is provided, students should update or extend `starter-code.py` in this folder and include any additional files (for example, a `words.txt`) if used.
